# Neural Networks from Scratch in `X`

The idea here is to share [Neural Networks from Scratch tutorial parts](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDcjD5BAw2DxE6OF2tius3V3) / [Neural Networks from Scratch book](https://nnfs.io) in various other programming languages, besides just Python.

If you're following along in another language, feel free to contribute to your specific language via a pull request. If you're considering trying to use another language, you can see how others have achieved writing the neural networks from scratch in other languages here too.
